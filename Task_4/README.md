# üìä Tableau Project ‚Äî Data Joining & Blending  

This project focuses on combining multiple data sources in Tableau using **Inner Join**, **Full Join**, **Cross Join**, and **Data Blending** methods to analyze **Book Sales**, **Electronic Sales**, and **Total Sales** across different regions and states.  

The objective of this project is to integrate two separate datasets ‚Äî one for electronic sales and another for book sales ‚Äî and build a unified view of performance metrics. Each technique demonstrates a different way of connecting and comparing data to uncover patterns in regional and state-level sales.  

Through the use of joins and blending, the project highlights how Tableau can be leveraged to build **data relationships**, consolidate multiple views, and visualize **combined insights** effectively. The resulting dashboards display total and category-wise performance, providing a complete perspective of sales distribution across geographic areas.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Inner Join ‚Äî Region & State Level Analysis  

### Objective  
Join **Book Sales** and **Electronic Sales** data sources using an **Inner Join**, and display the combined results in a **tabular format**.  

### Insights  
- Displays data where matching states are present in both data sources.  
- Shows **Book Sales**, **Electronic Sales**, and **Total Sales**.  
- Two-level view: *State-wise* and *Region-wise* summaries.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Full Join ‚Äî Area-wise Analysis  

### Objective  
Join **Books** and **Electronics** sheets using a **Full Join** to include all data from both sources and visualize total sales.  

### Insights  
- Displays all records from both data sources, including unmatched states.  
- Shows combined **Electronic**, **Book**, and **Total Sales** in a single line graph.  
- Helps identify areas with missing or mismatched data.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cross Join ‚Äî State-wise View  

### Objective  
Perform a **Cross Join** to explore every possible pairing between states and categories across the datasets.  

### Insights  
- Displays all possible combinations between data sources.  
- Highlights potential relationships and overlaps.  
- Useful for deep comparative and exploratory analysis.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Blending ‚Äî State-wise View  

### Objective  
Blend **Books** and **Electronics** data sources to compare **Book Sales**, **Electronic Sales**, and **Total Sales** on the basis of **State**.  

### Insights  
- Combines aggregated results from multiple sources.  
- Maintains separate data connections while linking key fields.  
- Provides an overall comparison of performance by state.
