# 📊 Tableau Project — Data Joining & Blending  

This project demonstrates how to **combine multiple data sources** in Tableau using **Inner Join**, **Full Join**, and **Data Blending** techniques to analyze **Book Sales**, **Electronic Sales**, and **Total Sales** across different regions and states.

## 🧩 1️⃣ Inner Join — Region & State Level Analysis  

### 🔹 Objective  
Join **Book Sales** and **Electronic Sales** data sources using an **Inner Join**, and display the combined results in a **tabular format**.  

### 🔹 Insights  
- Displays data where matching states are present in both data sources.  
- Shows **Book Sales**, **Electronic Sales**, and **Total Sales**.  
- Two-level view: *State-wise* and *Region-wise* summaries.

## Data Blending — State-wise View  

![hello](images/Screenshot%202025-10-30%20154238.png)

### 🔹 Objective  
Blend data from **Book** and **Electronic** data sources to display **Book Sales**, **Electronic Sales**, and **Total Sales** based on **State**.  

### 📊 Output  
Displays unified data view after blending two different data connections — allowing comparative analysis at the state level.

## Key Learnings  

✅ Use of **Inner Join** for common records only.  
✅ Use of **Full Join** to include all data points from both tables.  
✅ Practical application of **Data Blending** to merge information from separate sources.  
✅ Displaying **Sales comparison** using both **Tabular** and **Graphical** visualizations.
